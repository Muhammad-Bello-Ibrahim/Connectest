### Finding an Issue

- Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/Muhammad-Bello-Ibrahim/Connectest/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on an issue to let others know you're working on it

### Proposing New Features

Before starting work on a major feature:

1. Open an issue to discuss the feature
2. Wait for maintainer feedback
3. Get approval before implementing

This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures alignment with project goals.

## üíª Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring
- `test/` - for adding tests

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the code style guidelines (see below)
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

- Run the development server and test manually
- Ensure existing functionality still works
- Add tests for new features when possible

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our commit message guidelines (see below):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profile edit feature"
```

### 5. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync with the upstream repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 6. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request

- Go to your fork on GitHub
- Click "New Pull Request"
- Provide a clear title and description
- Link any related issues

## üìê Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use **TypeScript** for type safety
- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Use **functional components** with hooks in React
- Prefer **const** over **let**, avoid **var**
- Use **async/await** instead of promises chains

#### Example:

```typescript
// Good ‚úÖ
const getUserById = async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  const user = await User.findById(id);
  return user;
};

// Avoid ‚ùå
function getUserById(id) {
  return User.findById(id).then((user) => {
    return user;
  });
}
```

### React Components

- Use descriptive component names
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper prop types with TypeScript

#### Example:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick, disabled = false }) => {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}>
      {label}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Follow mobile-first approach
- Maintain consistency with existing design
- Use CSS variables for theme colors

### File Organization

- Place components in `/components` directory
- API routes go in `/app/api`
- Database models in `/lib/models`
- Utility functions in `/lib/utils.ts`

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `getUserData`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`)
- **Files**: kebab-case for utilities (e.g., `user-utils.ts`)

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Writing Tests

- Test files should be named `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`
- Place test files in the `/test` directory
- Write descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

#### Example:

```javascript
describe('User Authentication', () => {
  it('should successfully login with valid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should reject login with invalid credentials', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Manual Testing

Before submitting a PR:

1. Test your changes in the browser
2. Check responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Test with different user roles (Student, Admin, Dean)
4. Verify error handling

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

```

### Types
