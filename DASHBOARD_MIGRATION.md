# Dashboard Migration - Twitter-Like Design

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. **Replaced Main Dashboard Page**
**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Before:**
- Used old `<NewsfeedModern />` component
- Had welcome header with gradient text
- Container-based layout with padding

**After:**
- Complete Twitter-like feed design
- Sticky header with "For you" and "Following" tabs
- Inline composer for desktop
- Mobile bottom navigation
- Twitter-style post cards with interactions
- Full-width mobile, centered desktop (600px max-width)

### 2. **Updated Dashboard Layout**
**File:** `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Detects when on `/dashboard` home page
- Removes old `<MobileNav />` for dashboard home (uses its own)
- Removes mobile header for dashboard home
- Adjusts padding: `p-4` for dashboard home (negated by `-m-4` in page)
- Keeps old navigation for other routes (clubs, profile, settings)

### 3. **Removed Separate Newsfeed Route**
**Status:** `/dashboard/newsfeed` can now be deleted

The Twitter-like design is now the main dashboard experience.

## 🎨 Design Features

### Desktop Experience
- **Sidebar:** Left sidebar with navigation (Home, Clubs, Profile, Settings)
- **Feed:** Centered 600px column with borders
- **Composer:** Inline at top of feed
- **Tabs:** "For you" and "Following" with animated underline

### Mobile Experience
- **Full Width:** Content spans entire screen
- **Bottom Nav:** 5 icons (Home, Search/Clubs, Compose, Notifications/Settings, Profile)
- **Elevated Compose:** Circular FAB in center of nav
- **Dialog Composer:** Full-screen compose dialog
- **No Sidebar:** Sidebar hidden on mobile

### Post Cards
- **Avatar:** Clickable, links to profile
- **Actions:** Comment, Repost, Like (with fill animation), Share
- **Hover Effects:** Color-coded (blue, green, pink)
- **Dropdown Menu:** Save and Report options
- **Club Badges:** Styled badges for club posts

## 📱 Navigation Structure

### Mobile Bottom Nav (Dashboard Home Only)
1. **Home** - `/dashboard` (active)
2. **Search/Clubs** - `/dashboard/clubs`
3. **Compose** - Opens dialog
4. **Notifications/Settings** - `/dashboard/settings`
5. **Profile** - `/dashboard/profile`

### Old Mobile Nav (Other Routes)
- Still used for `/dashboard/clubs`, `/dashboard/profile`, etc.
- Maintains backward compatibility

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [posts, setPosts] = useState<Post[]>([])
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
const [newPostContent, setNewPostContent] = useState("")
const [isCreatingPost, setIsCreatingPost] = useState(false)
const [likingPosts, setLikingPosts] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [activeFeed, setActiveFeed] = useState<'forYou' | 'following'>('forYou')
const [showComposeDialog, setShowComposeDialog] = useState(false)
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/posts` - Fetch all posts
- `POST /api/posts` - Create new post
- `POST /api/posts/:id/like` - Like/unlike post

### Layout Logic
```typescript
const isDashboardHome = pathname === "/dashboard"

// Conditional rendering
{!isDashboardHome && <MobileNav />}  // Hide old nav on home
{!isDashboardHome && <DashboardHeader />}  // Hide header on home
```

### Negative Margin Trick
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-background -m-4">
```
This negates the `p-4` padding from the layout, allowing full-width design.

## 🎯 Responsive Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| **< 640px** | Full width, tight spacing, bottom nav |
| **640px - 768px** | Increased spacing, still full width |
| **≥ 768px** | Centered 600px, side borders, inline composer, sidebar visible |
