To create these labels in your repository:

Alternatively, you can use the GitHub CLI:

gh label create "priority:low" --description "Low priority issue" --color "d4c5f9"
gh label create "hacktoberfest" --description "Hacktoberfest eligible" --color "ff6b35"
gh label create "hacktoberfest-accepted" --description "PR accepted for Hacktoberfest" --color "2e8b57"
```

## Label Usage Guidelines

### Applying Multiple Labels

Issues can have multiple labels. Common combinations:

- `good first issue` + `documentation` + `priority:low`
- `bug` + `help wanted` + `priority:high`
- `enhancement` + `hacktoberfest` + `good first issue`

### Hacktoberfest-Specific Guidelines

#### Issues
- Apply `hacktoberfest` to issues you want Hacktoberfest participants to work on
- Combine with `good first issue` for beginner-friendly Hacktoberfest issues
- Ensure issues have clear descriptions and acceptance criteria

#### Pull Requests
- Add `hacktoberfest-accepted` to quality PRs that meet our standards
- Only apply to PRs that are meaningful and valuable
- Remove if PR quality doesn't meet standards (spam, trivial changes)

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Use multiple labels to clearly categorize issues
2. **Update Regularly**: Add/remove labels as issue status changes
3. **Consistent Application**: Follow these guidelines consistently
4. **Clear Communication**: Labels help contributors find suitable issues

## Setting Repository Topics

In addition to labels, add these topics to your repository:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è next to "About" on the right sidebar
3. Add these topics:
   - `hacktoberfest`
   - `nextjs`
   - `typescript`
   - `mongodb`
   - `university`
   - `club-management`
   - `student-platform`
   - `good-first-issue`

Topics help people discover your repository and are especially important for Hacktoberfest participation.

## Automation Tips (Optional)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions to:
- Auto-label PRs based on files changed
- Auto-label issues based on templates used
- Auto-add `hacktoberfest-accepted` to approved PRs during October

Example workflow can be added later if needed.
